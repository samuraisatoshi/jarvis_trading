BNB_USDT BACKTEST RESULTS: 4H vs 1D Models (2025 Data)
================================================================================

CRITICAL FINDING: Models DO NOT produce SELL signals!
Action space only produces: 0.0 (HOLD) or 2.0 (BUY)
Both models are effectively "buy-and-hold" strategies.

================================================================================
ACTUAL TRADING BEHAVIOR
================================================================================

4H Model:
  2025-02-03 08:00 | BUY  @ $576.16 (confidence: 2.0)
  ... (holds for 9+ months, never sells)
  2025-11-14 16:00 | AUTO-CLOSE @ $919.84
  Result: +59.72% (pure buy-and-hold)

1D Model:
  2025-08-02 00:00 | BUY  @ $736.42 (confidence: 2.0)
  ... (holds for 3+ months, never sells)
  2025-11-14 00:00 | AUTO-CLOSE @ $895.55
  Result: +24.98% (pure buy-and-hold from later entry)

================================================================================
ROOT CAUSE
================================================================================

Issue: Action space configuration incorrect
  - Current: Box(0, 2) or discrete {0, 1, 2} with broken SELL
  - Expected: Box(-1, 1) for continuous actions
  - Result: Models physically cannot produce SELL signals

Likely causes:
  1. Action space defined as [0, 2] instead of [-1, 1]
  2. VecNormalize clipping actions to positive values
  3. Training reward function biased toward "never sell"
  4. Training data only from bull markets (no bear market examples)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

DO NOT USE THESE MODELS FOR LIVE TRADING

Status: CRITICAL - Models are broken

Action Required:
  1. Fix action space in training configuration
  2. Verify PPO action_space parameter: should be Box(-1, 1, (1,))
  3. Retrain both models with corrected configuration
  4. Re-run backtests to verify SELL signals appear
  5. Only then consider paper trading

Risk Level: HIGH - Models have no downside protection

================================================================================
COMPARISON WITH BUY & HOLD
================================================================================

Pure Buy & Hold Strategy (BNB 2025):
  Jan 1 - Nov 14:  ~+60% (approximate)

Model Performance:
  4H Model: +59.72%  (same as B&H, no added value)
  1D Model: +24.98%  (worse than B&H, entered late)

Conclusion: Models provide ZERO advantage over simple buy-and-hold.
           In fact, 1D model performed WORSE than doing nothing.

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Review training code:
   - File: /finrl/training_scripts/train_bnb_models.py (likely location)
   - Check: action_space = Box(?, ?, (1,))
   - Fix: Should be Box(-1.0, 1.0, (1,))

2. Verify reward function:
   - Current: Sharpe Ratio only
   - Add: Trading frequency incentive
   - Add: Penalty for excessive holding

3. Retrain with corrected configuration:
   - Include bear market data (2018, 2022)
   - Verify SELL signals in training logs
   - Test on validation set before 2025 backtest

4. Re-run this backtest:
   - Expect: Multiple buy/sell round trips
   - Expect: Active trading (10-30% of candles)
   - Expect: Win rate 45-60%
